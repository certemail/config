-firewalld classified incoming network traffic into zones
-every packet that comes into the system will be checked for its source address
    -if that source address is tied to a specific zone, then rules for that zone apply
    -if a network interface is not associated with a zone, then default zone used

-ensure that iptables is not running and firewalld is on:
    # systemctl mask iptables
    # systemctl mask iptables6
    # systemctl status firewalld
    # systemctl start firewalld
    # systemctl enable firewalld

-pre-defined zones (firewalld.zones(5) man page):
    # firewall-cmd --list-all-zones            		// list zones and their settings

    * by default, all zones permit:
        1) incoming traffic which is part of a communication initiaed by the system
        2) any outgoing traffic

    * trusted:  allow all incoming traffic
    * home:     allow ssh, mdns, ipp-client, samba-client, dhcpv6-client
    * internal: allow ssh, mdns, ipp-client, samba-client, dhcpv6-client
    * work:     allow ssh, ipp-client, dhcpv6
    * public:   allow ssh, dhcpv6-client
    * external: allow ssh (outgoing IPv4 forwarded is masqueraded to appear to originate from network iface)
    * dmz:      allow ssh
    * block:    reject all incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic
    * drop:     drop ALL traffic and no ICMP response back
  
-pre-defined services:
    # firewall-cmd --get-services                    // list all pre-defined services (ssh, http, https, etc.)

-firewall-cmd:                                       // if [--zone=<ZONE>] is not specified, then uses default zone                                
    # firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
    # firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=<ZONE>
    # firewall-cmd --get-services                    // list pre-defined services
    # firewall-cmd --get-active-zones                // list all zones in use w/ an interface or source tied to them
    # firewall-cmd --add-source=<source>[/<MASK>]    // route all traffic from network/netmask to specified zone
    # firewall-cmd --remove-source=<source>[/<MASK>] // remove rule routing traffic from source to zone
    # firewall-cmd --add-interface=<INTERFACE>       // route all traffic from interface to zone
    # firewall-cmd --add-port=<PORT/PROTOCOL>        // allow traffic to PORT/PROTOCOL
    # firewall-cmd --remove-service=<SERVICE>        // remove service from allowed list
    # firewall-cmd --remove-port=<PORT/PROTOCOL>     // remove PORT/PROTOCOL from allowed list
    # firewall-cmd --permanent                       // permanent change (only after reload or reboot)
    # firewall-cmd --reload                          // drop runtime configuration and apply persistent config

-example:
    -set default zone to "dmz", all traffic coming from 192.168.0.0/24 assigned to internal zone,
     and network ports for mysql opened on internal zone

     # firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=dmz
     # firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-source=192.168.0.0/24
     # firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=mysql
     # firewall-cmd --reload

-firewalld services are defined in XML files in:
    /usr/lib/firewalld/services/            // do NOT modify (system default)
    /etc/firewalld/services/                // if creating own custom service, add it here

-GUI firewall
    # yum install firewall-config
    # firewall-config
